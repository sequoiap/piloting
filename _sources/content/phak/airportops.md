# Airport Operations

## Lost Communication Procedures

If you have a radio malfunction (transmit, receive, or both) and need to land at a towered airport:

1. Remain outside or above Class D until direction or flow of traffic is determined.
1. Advise tower of aircraft type, position, altitude, and intention to land (if you have transmit).
1. Continue, enter pattern, report position as appropriate, watch for light signals from tower (see diagram below).
1. If transmitter becomes inoperative, follow above procedures and monitor appropriate ATC frequency. 
1. Acknowledge by rocking the wings (daylight) or blinking the landing light (night).

When both receiver and transmitter are out, the same applies, but without the calls. Watch for light signals.

Radio should be fixed before flying again, although if not possible, it's possible to request a "no radio" (NORDO) procedure by telephone for a VFR departure without two-way radio (not available at busy airports).
