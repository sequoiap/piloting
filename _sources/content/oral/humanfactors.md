# Human Factors

## Health conditions

```{dropdown} hypoxia
* Too little oxygen.
* Can cause headaches, drowsiness, impaired decision making, and eventually loss of consciousness.

*hypoxic*

* In sufficient oxygen available to the body.
* Less oxygen at altitude.

*hypemic*

* Blood cannot carry enough oxygen.
* Reduced blood volume, CO poisoning.

*stagnant*

* Blood not flowing.
* Shock, heart problems, clogged artery.
* Could be brought on by excessive G's.

*histotoxic*

* Inability of cells to use oxygen, though enough is circulating.
* Drugs, alcohol, poisons can cause this.
```

```{dropdown} hyperventilation
* Nerves, panic or anxiety may cause this condition
* Rapid or deep breathing, bringing too much oxygen to the lungs. 
* Very low levels of carbon dioxide in your blood 
* May cause dizziness or light-headedness, shortness of breath, weakness and confusion. 
* Raise the levels of carbon dioxide in your blood by slowing breathing or breathing into and out of a paper bag (less oxygen, more carbon dioxide).
```

```{dropdown} middle ear & sinus problems
* If congestsed, may cause extreme discomfort at higher altitudes or upon descent.
* Trouble equalizing air pressure in your inner ear.
```

```{dropdown} spatial disorientation
* Occurs when flying in IMC and your body receives conflicting signals.
* Trust the instruments.
```

```{dropdown} motion sickness
* Body receives conflicting signals.
* Reduce rapid head motion, focus on an object outside the aircraft.
* Usually goes away with experience.
```

```{dropdown} CO poisoning
* Colorless, odorless, though smell of exhaust can indicate its presence.
* Turn off heater, open air vents and windows.
* Deadly at high enough doses.
```

```{dropdown} stress & fatigue
* Acute (manageable) and chronic (requires medical professional).
* Getting frazzled in the cockpit vs. loneliness, other psychological stressors.
* Get enough consistent rest! Don't fly tired or stressed!
```

```{dropdown} dehydration
* Too little water.
* Drink 2-4 quarts of water per day.
```

```{dropdown} alcohol and drugs
* Depressants, can have side effects.
* Impairs judgment.
* Don't fly with blood alcohol level greater than 0.04 percent or within 8 hours of drinking.
* Consult an AME about drugs and medications. Don't take any elective medications.
```

```{dropdown} decompression sickness/scuba diving
* Excess nitrogen in the blood comes out of solution at lower pressures (higher altitudes).
* Causes a painful symptom in your joints known as "the bends."
* Wait 12 hours or more for nondecompression stop diving.
* Wait 24 hours or more for dives requiring decompression stops.

## Hazardous attitudes

1. **Anti-authority:** “Don’t tell me!”
   Pilots with an anti-authority attitude tend to believe that rules, regulations, and safety procedures don’t apply to them. For example, an anti-authority pilot may neglect their checklists or refuse to take advice from instructors or ATC. Be advised that having an anti-authority attitude is different from simply questioning authority. Pilots always have the prerogative to speak up to authority if they believe a mistake has been made.

1. **Impulsivity:** “Do something quickly!”
   According to the FAA, an attitude of impulsivity is found in pilots who “feel the need to do something, anything, immediately.” Instead of taking a moment to think things through or select the best alternative, a pilot with an impulsive attitude does the first thing that comes to mind. Reacting too quickly can lead to irrational decisions, such as skipping a preflight or rushing to get home despite inclement weather. Pilots are encouraged to take time to evaluate their options before choosing a course of action.

1. **Invulnerability:** “It won’t happen to me!”
   Many people—not just pilots—fall into a pattern of thinking that accidents happen to others, but never to them. This attitude of invulnerability can become a safety concern when pilots fail to consider the risks of their actions.

1. **Macho:** “I can do it!”
   Pilots with a macho attitude are always trying to impress others and prove themselves by taking unnecessary risks. Both men and women are susceptible to a macho attitude, which leads to foolish and often dangerous behavior. While pilots must have a high level of confidence in their abilities, it’s important to avoid becoming overconfident and adopting a macho attitude.

1. **Resignation:** “What’s the use?”
   Finally, pilots with an attitude of resignation lack the confidence and conviction to believe they can make a difference in what happens to them. These pilots tend to give up easily when faced with challenges and don’t take criticism well. This attitude is particularly dangerous for pilots in an emergency situation because they may believe they are helpless and resign to their fate instead of taking action.
