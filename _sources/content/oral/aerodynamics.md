# Principles of Aerodynamics

## 4 forces of flight

## Flight controls & maneuvering

**Ailerons**

Ailerons control motion around the longitudinal axis (roll). Ailerons are controlled differentially; raising them on one side of the aircraft will force them down on the other. Raising the aileron on one side will decrease the angle of attack, giving less lift, while at the same time increasing the angle of attack on the opposing side, increasing lift, and putting the aircraft into a bank.

**Elevators**

Elevators control motion about the lateral axis (pitch). Pulling back on the controls deflects the elevators upward, forcing the tail down and placing the aircraft in a nose-up attitude. The converse is also true.

**Rudder**

The rudder controls motion about the vertical axis (yaw). A left deflection pushes the tail to the right, point the nose towards the left.

## Ground effect, stability & load factor

Ground effect is the reduced aerodynamic drag that an aircraft's wings generate when they are close to a fixed surface. Reduced drag when in ground effect during takeoff can cause the aircraft to "float" while below the recommended climb speed. The pilot can then fly just above the runway while the aircraft accelerates in ground effect until a safe climb speed is reached ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_effect_(aerodynamics))).

Stability is an aircraft's ability to maintain/return to its original flight path.

Two kinds of stability:

1. Static stability: initial tendency of aircraft once disturbed
    1. Positive: Returns to original position
    1. Neutral: Stays at new position
    1. Negative: Continues away from original position
1. Dynamic stability: tendency over time (positive static is required for dynamic stability)
    1. Positive: Dampens towards original position
    1. Neutral: Oscillates a constant amount
    1. Negative: Unstable oscillation (response gets worse with time)

Three axes of stability:

1. Longitudinal: nose to tail (roll)
1. Lateral: wingtip to wingtip (pitch)
1. Vertical: rotation about CG (yaw)

## Stall awareness, spins & spin recovery

**Spin recovery**

| Letter | Stands for | Description |
|:-------|:-----------|:------------|
| P | Power to idle | When you're at a high power setting, airflow from your propeller strikes your horizontal stabilizer, causing a tail-down force and pitching your nose up. |
| A | Ailerons neutral | When you bring your ailerons to neutral, you help your wings reach the same angle-of-attack, which helps you reduce the rolling and yawing moments in the spin. |
| R | Rudder opposite spin | When you add opposite rudder, you stop the rolling and yawing moment of the spin. |
| E | Elevator forward | Breaking the stall. Once you have your plane configured to fly out of the spin (steps 1-3), it's time to reduce your angle-of-attack and keep on flying. |
