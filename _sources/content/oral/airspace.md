## Special use airspace

Based on [CFI Notebook](https://www.cfinotebook.net/notebook/national-airspace-system/special-use-airspace).

```{dropdown} Prohibited airspace

* Area within which flight of aircraft is prohibited. 
* Prohibited areas are established for security or other reasons associated with the national welfare. 
* These areas are regulatory in nature, and violating an area is grounds for interception and legal action. 
* These areas are depicted on aeronautical charts. Areas are charted as "P" followed by a designation number.

```

```{dropdown} Restricted airspace

* Area within which flight is not wholly prohibited, but subject to restrictions.
* Restricted Areas are subject to restriction as they contain unusual, often invisible hazards to Aircraft, such as artillery firing, aerial gunnery, or flight of guided missiles
* Penetration of restricted areas without authorization from the using or controlling agency may be extremely hazardous to the Aircraft and its occupants
* Regulatory in nature
* Depicted on charts, identified with an "R" followed by a number.

```

```{dropdown} National security areas

* National Security Areas (NSAs) are established at locations where there is a requirement for increase security and safety of ground facilities
* Depicted inside a magenta dash, similar as a class echo Airspace extension to surface, but larger
* Pilots are requested to voluntarily avoid flying through a depicted NSA
* Regulated under Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part 99
* Flight inside NSAs may be temporarily prohibited by regulation under the provisions of FAR 99.7 when necessary
    * Regulatory prohibitions will be issued by System Operations Security and disseminated via NOTAM
    * Prohibitions will be issued by Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM), when required

```

```{dropdown} Military operating areas

* Military Operating Areas (MOAs) are blocks of Airspace that are established to separate certain military training activities from Instrument Flight Rule (IFR) traffic

* Activities contained within MOAs include:

    * Air Combat Tactics
    * Air Intercepts
    * Aerobatics
    * Formation Training
    * Low Altitude Tactics (see also: Military Training Routes)

* These areas are non-regulatory and do not require pilot participation.

**Visual Flight Rules (VFR) traffic**

* Pilots operating under VFR should exercise extreme caution while flying within a MOA when military activity is being conducted
* The pilot should contact the controlling agency when operating within 100 NM of the MOA to be crossed as the status (active/inactive) may change frequently
* While flight through an active MOA is not prohibited to civilian traffic, it is a very bad idea due to dynamic operations in this airspace
* Despite the safety hazard, it will cause military activity to "knock-it-off," resulting in wasted time and gas

**Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) traffic**

* Whenever an MOA is being used, non-participating IFR traffic may be cleared through an MOA if IFR separation can be provided by Air Traffic Control (ATC)
* Otherwise, ATC will reroute or restrict non-participating IFR traffic

```

```{dropdown} Controlled firing areas

* Controlled Firing Areas (CFAs) contain activities which, if not conducted in a controlled environment, could be hazardous to non-participating aircraft (e.g. military artillery operations).
* CFAs are not depicted on a map as they do not cause a non-participating Aircraft to change its flight path
* When a spotter Aircraft, radar or ground personnel determine an Aircraft might be approaching the area, the activities are discontinued
* Non-regulatory in nature
```

```{dropdown} Alert areas

* Alert areas are depicted on aeronautical charts to inform nonparticipating pilots of areas that may contain high volumes pilot training, parachute jumping, glider towing, or an unusual type of aerial activity.
* Alert areas are non-regulatory in nature

![Alert area information](/images/alert-area-explanation.png)
```

```{dropdown} Warning area

* Area extending from 3 NM and outward from the coast of the U.S., that contains activity that may be hazardous to nonparticipating aircraft.
* Warning areas may be located over domestic or international waters or both
* Vertical dimensions are not depicted on charts. For floors and ceilings you must reference the Special Use Airspace table on the edge of the aeronautical charts.
* The U.S. Government does not have sole jurisdiction over the Airspace and is shared with the U.S. Navy
* Warning areas may be considered for joint use if the area can be released to the FAA during periods when it is not required for its designated purpose, and provided the warning area is located in Airspace wherein the FAA exercises ATC authority under ICAO agreements
