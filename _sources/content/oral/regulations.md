## NTSB accident reporting requirements

```{dropdown} aircraft incident
Aircraft accident means an occurrence associated with the operation of an aircraft which takes place between the time any person boards the aircraft with the intention of flight and all such persons have disembarked, and in which any person suffers death or serious injury, or in which the aircraft receives substantial damage. 
```

```{dropdown} aircraft accident
Incident means an occurrence other than an accident, associated with the operation of an aircraft, which affects or could affect the safety of operations. 
```

```{dropdown} serious injury
Serious injury means any injury which: 

1. Requires hospitalization for more than 48 hours, commencing within 7 days from the date of the injury was received;
1. Results in a fracture of any bone (except simple fractures of fingers, toes, or nose); 
1. Causes severe hemorrhages, nerve, muscle, or tendon damage;
1. Involves any internal organ; or 
1. Involves second- or third-degree burns, or any burns affecting more than 5 percent of the body surface. 
```

```{dropdown} fatal injury
Fatal injury means any injury which results in death within 30 days of the accident. 
```

```{dropdown} substantial damage
Substantial damage means damage or failure which adversely affects the structural strength, performance, or flight characteristics of the aircraft, and which would normally require major repair or replacement of the affected component. Engine failure or damage limited to an engine if only one engine fails or is damaged, bent fairings or cowling, dented skin, small punctured holes in the skin or fabric, ground damage to rotor or propeller blades, and damage to landing gear, wheels, tires, flaps, engine accessories, brakes, or wingtips are not considered “substantial damage” for the purpose of this part.

## Aviation Safety Reporting Program

Pilots can self-report incidents to NASA under the Aviation Safety Reporting Program. The FAA will not use any reports submitted to that program for any enforcement action against pilots, except in the case of accidents or criminal offenses. By submitting a report within 10 days, the pilot may be provided some immunity from civil penalty or supension of certificate by the FAA. 

## AIM & advisory circulars

The Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM) is the FAA's official guide to basic flight information and Air traffic control (ATC) procedures. The AIM contains the basic aeronautical knowledge information required to fly in the United States National Airspace System. It also contains items of interest to pilots concerning health and medical facts, factors affecting flight safety, a pilot/controller glossary of terms used in the ATC System, and information on safety, accident, and hazard reporting ([source](https://www.faraim.org/)).

Advisory circular (AC) refers to a type of publication offered by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to provide guidance for compliance with airworthiness regulations, pilot certification, operational standards, training standards, and any other rules within the 14 CFR Aeronautics and Space Title. They define acceptable means, but not the only means, of accomplishing or showing compliance with airworthiness regulations.[1] Generally informative in nature, Advisory Circulars are neither binding nor regulatory; yet some have the effect of de facto standards or regulations ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advisory_circular)).
