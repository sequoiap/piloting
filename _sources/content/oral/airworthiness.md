# Airworthiness Requirements

## Airworthiness, registration & placards

### Airworthiness

* An airworthiness certificate is an FAA document which grants authorization to operate an aircraft in flight.
* There are two different classifications of FAA airworthiness certificates: Standard Airworthiness Certificate, and Special Airworthiness Certificate.
* A standard airworthiness certificate remains valid as long as the aircraft meets its approved type design, is in a condition for safe operation and maintenance, preventative maintenance, and alterations are performed in accordance with 14 CFR parts 21, 43, and 91.
* When purchasing a used aircraft, the existing standard airworthiness certificate is transferable to you.
* The FAA can revoke an existing airworthiness certificate in any category (14 CFR section 21.181), if the aircraft no longer meets its approved design and/or is not in an airworthy condition.

### Registration

* The registration certificate is one of the required documents that must be carried aboard an aircraft in order for it to be considered airworthy.
* Once an initial registration has been completed, renewals will be required, every 3 years.
* Renewals may be submitted during the six months preceding the expiration date.

### Placards

* For small aircraft there are regulations concerning certain required placards, such as FAR 23.791 - Passenger Information Signs and FAR 23.1557 - Miscellaneous markings and placards. These are certification standards that the FAA requires manufacturers to adhere to.
* Manufacturers then publish a list of required placards and the verbiage to use.
* Interior and exterior placard requirements can be found in Chapter 11 of the aircraft maintenance manual or illustrated parts catalog.

## AFM/weight & balance

* Center of gravity bounds
* Max weight limitations

## VFR day/night required instruments

### [Day](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91#p-91.205(b))

* Airspeed indicator
* Altimeter
* Magnetic direction indicator
* Tachometer (per engine)
* Oil pressure gauge (per engine)
* Temperature gauge (per engine)
* Oil temperature gauge (per engine)
* Manifold pressure gauge (per engine)
* Fuel gauge (all tanks)
* Landing gear position indicator
* Anticollision light system
* Flotation gear, if operated for hire over water farther than gliding distance from shore
* Safety belts
* ELT, except as provided in [14 CFR 91.207](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-C/section-91.207)

### [Night](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91#p-91.205(c))

Everything for day VFR, plus: 

* Fuses, one spare set or three of each kind
* Landing light, if operated for hire
* Anticollision lights
* Position lights
* Source of electrical energy for all installed electrical and radio equipment

## Inop equipment with & without MEL

### With MEL

* Specific to a make and model of an aircraft.
* If it's acceptable to fly without the equipment, it should be logged, left off, and placarded as INOPERATIVE.

### Without MEL

* Are the inoperative instruments part of day VFR certification requirements (or required by the specific flight operation, e.g. IFR, night, etc.)?
* Is the equipment listed as "required" on the aircraft's equipment list?
* Is the equipement required to be operational by an AD?

## Special flight permit

For aircraft not currently meeting airworthiness requirements but is capable of safe flying. Might be issued for:

* Flying somewhere for repairs, maintenance, storage
* Delivering/exporting aircraft
* Flight testing new aircraft
* Evacuating aircraft from impending danger
* Customer demonstrations, for aircraft that have completed production flight tests

Obtain from your local [FSDO](https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/field_offices/fsdo/).

## Airworthiness directives

* Airworthiness Directives (ADs) are legally enforceable regulations issued by the FAA in accordance with 14 CFR part 39 to correct an unsafe condition in a product. Part 39 defines a product as an aircraft, engine, propeller, or appliance.
* Three types of ADs:
    * Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), followed by a Final Rule
    * Final Rule; Request for Comments
    * Emergency ADs

## MTX/inspection requirements

* Annual inspections: within the preceding 12 months
* Airworthiness directives, life-limited parts
* VOR equipment check: every 30 days (for IFR)
* 100-hour inspections: if used for hire or flight instruction in CFI-provided aircraft
    * Can exceed by not more than 10 hours
    * Next 100-hour is from previous 100-hour due time, not from inspection time
* Altimeter, altitude reporting equipment, static pressure system: every 24 calendar months (for IFR)
* Transponder tests and inspections: every 24 calendar months
* ELT transmitter, operation, battery: every 12 calendar months

## Maintenance records

* All procedures should be systematically logged, with a description of the work, the date and the signature, certification number and type of certification held by the person performing maintenance. That person’s signature serves as an approval for the aircraft to return to service only regarding the work they signed off on. ([source](https://aircraftmaintenancestands.com/blog/aircraft-preventive-maintenance/))
* This includes preventive maintenance.

## Preventative maintenance

The types of preventive maintenance permitted in aviation are limited to 31 items, which can be found listed in [14 CFR Part 43 Appendix A](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-43/appendix-Appendix%20A%20to%20Part%2043). Any tasks not listed are not considered preventive maintenance, which means a pilot cannot complete them without supervision. A (non-exhaustive) preventive maintenance list includes:

* Replacing safety belts.
* Replacing or cleaning spark plugs.
* Changing and repairing landing gear tires.
* Replenishing hydraulic fluid.
* Replacing and servicing batteries.
* Replacing safety wires.
* Checking oil levels and condition.
* Replacing air filters.
* Lubricating components that don’t require disassembly.
