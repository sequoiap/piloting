# Aeronautical Decision Making and Judgment

aeronautical decision making (ADM)
: A systematic approach to risk assessment and stress management.

Steps for good decision making:

1. Identifying personal attitudes hazardous to safe flight.
1. Learning behavior modification techniques.
1. Learning how to recognize and cope with stress.
1. Developing risk assessment skills.
1. Using all resources.
1. Evaluating the effectiveness of oneâ€™s ADM skills.

## Risk Management

### Four Fundamental Principles

1. Accept no unnecessary risk. Flying inherently has some risk; don't increase it.
1. Make risk decisions at the appropriate level. You are the pilot-in-command; don't let anyone else, ATC or passenger, make risk decisions for you.
1. Accept risk when benefits outweigh dangers. For example, a day with good weather is a much better time to fly an unfamiliar airplane.
1. Integrate risk management into planning at all levels. Not just in preflight planning, but in all stages of flight.

### Risk Management Process

1. Identify hazards
1. Assess risks
1. Analyze controls
1. Make control decisions
1. Use controls
1. Monitor results

### Single Pilot Resource Management (SRM)

single pilot resource management (SRM)
: The art and science of managing all the resources (both on-board the aircraft and from outside sources) available to a single pilot to ensure the successful outcome of a flight.

Concepts included:

* aeronautical decision making (ADM)
* risk management (RM)
* task management (TM)
* automation management (AM)
* controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) awareness
* situational awareness (SA)

hazard
: A real or perceived condition, event, or circumstance that a pilot encounters.

risk
: An assessment of the single or cumulative hazard facing a pilot.

human factors
: Elements or factors affecting individuals decision making. Transcends education, experience, health, physiology, etc.

### Hazardous attitudes and antidotes

| Hazardous attitude | Antidote |
| --- | --- |
| **Anti-authority.** "No one can tell me what to do." May regard rules and regulations as silly and unnecessary. | Follow the rules. They are usually right. |
| **Impulsivity.** "Do it quickly." People who feel the need to do something, anything, immediately. | Not so fast. Think first. |
| **Invulnerability.** "It won't happen to me." The invulnerable pilot is more likely to take chances. | It could happen to me. |
| **Macho.** "I can do it." The macho pilot is a show-off who is trying to impress others. | Taking chances is foolish. |
| **Resignation.** "What's the use?" The resigned pilot does not see himself as having control of his destiny. | I'm not helpless. I can make a difference. |

### Risk assessment models

**Likelihood of an event**

* Probable: an event will occur several times.
* Occasional: an event will probably occur sometime.
* Remote: an event is unlikely to occur, but is possible.
* Improbable: an event is unlikely to occur.

**Severity of an event**

* Catastrophic: results in fatalities, total loss
* Critical: Severe injury, major damage
* Marginal: minor injury, minor damage
* Negligible: less than minor injury, less than minor system damage

### Mitigating Risk

#### IMSAFE

1. Illness: am I sick?
1. Medication: am I taking any medications that might affect my judgment or make me drowsy?
1. Stress: am I under psychological pressure from the job? Do I have money, health, or family problems?
1. Alcohol: have I been drinking within the last 8 or 24 hours?
1. Fatigue: am I tired and not adequately rested?
1. Emotion: am I emotionally upset?

#### PAVE

1. Pilot-in-command
    * Am I ready for this trip?
1. Aircraft
    * Is this the right aircraft?
    * Am I familiar with the aircraft?
    * Is it equipped for the flight?
    * Can we use the intended runways?
    * Can it carry the required load?
1. enVironment
    * Weather
        * Clouds, icing, winds, mountains, thunderstorms.
        * Forecast may be inaccurate or have changed.
    * Terrain
        * Determine safe altitudes during planning
    * Airport
        * What lights are available at the destination/alternates?
        * NOTAMs
    * Airspace
        * Adequate survival gear, if flying over remote areas and forced to down?
        * TFRs
    * Nighttime
        * Be prepared to fly IFR
        * Can you safely perform an emergency landing at night?
        * Carry two flashlights; one for preflight, and a dim one for the cockpit
1. External pressures
    * Passengers waiting for your arrival or departure
    * Desire to impress someone
    * Personal goals (get-there-itis)

#### The 5 P's

1. The Plan
    * The mission, or the task
1. The Plane
    * The mechanics.
    * Includes database currency, automation status, emergency backup systems
1. The Pilot
    * High altitudes, long trips requiring significant endurance, challenging weather.
    * Advanced avionics.
1. The Passengers
    * Needs to get to a certain place by a certain time can pressure the pilot.
    * Make alternative plans for passengers, just-in-case.
    * Passengers can also be pilots. Make sure someone is designated as PIC to avoid conflict in decision-making.
    * Passengers can also make decisions. They may not feel comfortable with certain decisions.
1. The Programming
    * All the fancy electronics can be distracting.
    * Plan when you'll use these tools, and when you will not.

#### Perceive, Process, Perform (3P) Model

Identify hazards.

1. Perceive the given set of circumstances for a flight
1. Process by evaluating their impact on flight safety
1. Perform by implementing the best course of action

#### CARE checklist

Review hazards and evaluate risks.

1. Consequences: departing after a full workday creates fatigue and pressure
1. Alternatives: delay until morning, reschedule, drive
1. Reality: dangers and distractions of fatigue could lead to an accident
1. External pressures: business meeting at destination might influence me

#### TEAM checklist

Once you have perceived a hazard and processed its ipnact on flight safety, it is time to perform.

1. Transfer: Should the risk decison be transferred to someone else (e.g., consult the chief flight instructor)?
1. Eliminate: Is there a way to eliminate the hazard?
1. Accept: Do the benefits of accepting the risk outweight the costs?
1. Mitigate: What can you do to mitigate the risk?
