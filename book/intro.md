# Introduction

Dear fellow aviator,

Welcome to this pilot's resource! I like to call it "the PHAK, but shorter,"
because do you ever feel like a book is being verbose for the sake of verbosity?
There's a lot of stuff in the PHAK that could be stated much more succinctly--
especially for people trying to study or prepare for the written and oral 
checkrides. So this is my "sparknotes" version.

I've been working on my private pilot's license, and plan on getting my
instrument rating after that. I'm not (at present) planning on aviation as a
career, however. So--you can keep that in mind as you use this resource. Also, 
this resource will probably grow as I continue getting new ratings and studying 
new topics.

This website is built with JupyterBook and is hosted on GitHub. It's mostly 
written in Markdown. If you know code (or markdown, or feel so inclined to
learn), I'm happy to review pull requests and merge relevant content.

Happy flying!
Sequoia
