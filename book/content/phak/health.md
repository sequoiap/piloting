# Health Conditions

hypoxia
: At higher elevations, there is less oxygen in the air you breathe (since 
  air density is less, there are fewer molecules per breath). This can cause
  headaches, drowsiness, impaired decision making, and eventually loss of 
  consciousness.

hyperventilation
: Nerves, panic or anxiety may cause this condition, which is rapid or deep
  breathing, bringing too much oxygen to the lungs. It leaves you with very 
  low levels of carbon dioxide in your blood, and may cause dizziness or 
  light-headedness, shortness of breath, weakness and confusion. The goal is to
  raise the levels of carbon dioxide in your blood by slowing breathing or
  breathing into and out of a paper bag (less oxygen, more carbon dioxide).

middle ear & sinus problems
: If you are congestsed, it may cause extreme discomfort at higher altitudes
  or when descending to your destination, as you will have trouble equalizing
  air pressure in your inner ear.

motion sickness

CO poisoning
