Note where the large aircraft rotated, and rotate before that point. Remain 
above and upwind of the leading aircraft's path.
```

```{dropdown} En route
Remain above and upwind of the larger aircraft's path. Wake tends to descend

Vortices descend approximately 300-500 fpm for the first 30 seconds.
