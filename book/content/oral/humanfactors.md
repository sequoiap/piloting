# Human Factors

## Health conditions

```{dropdown} hypoxia
* Too little oxygen.
* Can cause headaches, drowsiness, impaired decision making, and eventually loss of consciousness.

*hypoxic*

* In sufficient oxygen available to the body.
* Less oxygen at altitude.

*hypemic*

* Blood cannot carry enough oxygen.
* Reduced blood volume, CO poisoning.

*stagnant*

* Blood not flowing.
* Shock, heart problems, clogged artery.
* Could be brought on by excessive G's.

*histotoxic*

* Inability of cells to use oxygen, though enough is circulating.
* Drugs, alcohol, poisons can cause this.
```

```{dropdown} hyperventilation
* Nerves, panic or anxiety may cause this condition
* Rapid or deep breathing, bringing too much oxygen to the lungs. 
* Very low levels of carbon dioxide in your blood 
* May cause dizziness or light-headedness, shortness of breath, weakness and confusion. 
* Raise the levels of carbon dioxide in your blood by slowing breathing or breathing into and out of a paper bag (less oxygen, more carbon dioxide).
```

```{dropdown} middle ear & sinus problems
* If congestsed, may cause extreme discomfort at higher altitudes or upon descent.
* Trouble equalizing air pressure in your inner ear.
```

```{dropdown} spatial disorientation
* Occurs when flying in IMC and your body receives conflicting signals.
* Trust the instruments.
```

```{dropdown} motion sickness
* Body receives conflicting signals.
* Reduce rapid head motion, focus on an object outside the aircraft.
* Usually goes away with experience.
```

```{dropdown} CO poisoning
* Colorless, odorless, though smell of exhaust can indicate its presence.
* Turn off heater, open air vents and windows.
* Deadly at high enough doses.
```

```{dropdown} stress & fatigue
* Acute (manageable) and chronic (requires medical professional).
* Getting frazzled in the cockpit vs. loneliness, other psychological stressors.
* Get enough consistent rest! Don't fly tired or stressed!
```

```{dropdown} dehydration
* Too little water.
* Drink 2-4 quarts of water per day.
```

```{dropdown} alcohol and drugs
* Depressants, can have side effects.
* Impairs judgment.
* Don't fly with blood alcohol level greater than 0.04 percent or within 8 hours of drinking.
* Consult an AME about drugs and medications. Don't take any elective medications.
```

```{dropdown} decompression sickness/scuba diving
* Excess nitrogen in the blood comes out of solution at lower pressures (higher altitudes).
* Causes a painful symptom in your joints known as "the bends."
* Wait 12 hours or more for nondecompression stop diving.
* Wait 24 hours or more for dives requiring decompression stops.
