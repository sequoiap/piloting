# Weather Theory and Hazards

## Atmosphere, patterns ,Coriolis force

## Air masses & fronts

## Temperature/pressure/humidity

## Moisture: clouds, fog & precipitation

## Stability, convection & inversions

## Turbulence, wind shear & microburst

## Clouds & ceilings

For clouds to form, their must be adequate water vapor and condesation nuclei,
as well as a method by which the air can be cooled. When the air cools and
reaches its saturation point, invisible water vapor changes into a visible
state.

Clouds are classified according to height:

* **Low**: form near the Earth's surface and extend up to about 6,500 ft AGL.
  Composed of water droplets, but can include supercooled water droplets that
  induce hazardous aircraft icing. Creates low ceilings, hamper visibility, and
  can change rapidly. They can make VFR flight impossible. Fog is classified as
  a type of low cloud formation.
* **Middle**: form around 6,500 ft and extend up to 20,000 ft AGL. Composed of
  water, ice crystals, and supercooled water droplets.
* **High**: form above 20,000 ft AGL. Composed of ice crystals and pose no real
  threat of turbulence or aircraft icing. Usually only form in stable air.
* **Clouds with extensive vertical development**: cumulus clouds that build
  vertically into towering cumuls or cumulonimbus clouds. Bases form in the low
  to middle cloud base region butbut can extend into high altitude cloud
  levels. Indicates areas of instability in the atmosphere, and the air around
  and inside them is turbulent. Often develop into thunderstorms. When hidden
  within other cloud formations, they are called "embedded thunderstorms."


Cloud classifications:

* **Cumulus**: heaped or piled clouds
* **Stratus**: formed in layers
* **Cirrus**: wispy, fibrous, feathery clouds, also high level clouds above 20,000 ft.
* **Castellanus**: common base with separate vertical development, castle-like
* **Lenticularus**: lens-shaped, formed over mountains in strong winds
* **Nimbus**: rain-bearing clouds
* **Fracto**: ragged or broken
* **Alto**: middle level clouds existing at 5,000-20,000 ft

ceiling 
: The lowest layer of clouds reported as being broken or overcast, or the 
  vertical visibility into an obscuration like fog or haze.

Clouds are reported as broken when five-eights to seven-eights of the sky is
covered with clouds. Overcast means the entire sky is covered with clouds.

## Low visibility, precipitation & fog

visibility 
: The greatest horizontal distance at which prominent objects can be
  viewed with the naked eye.

precipitation
: Any type of water particles that form in the atmosphere and fall to the ground.

Precipitation can reduce visibility, create icing situations, and affect 
landing and takeoff performance of an aircraft.

It occurs in several forms as it falls towards the Earth, including:

* drizzle (very small water droplets, smaller than 0.02 in. in diameter)
* rain (water droplets larger than drizzle)
* ice pellets
* hail
* snow
* ice

virga
: Rain that falls through the atmosphere but evaporates prior to striking the 
  ground

Frrezing rain and freezing drizzle occur when the temperature of the surface is
below freezing; the rain freezes on contact with the cooler surface.

## Structural & induction icing

## Thunderstorms, hail & lightning

These are extremely turbulent and pose a significant hazard to flight safety.
An aircraft could experience updrafts and downdrafts that exceed 3,000 fpm.
Thunderstorms can also produce hail, lightning, tornadoes, and large quantities
of waterâ€”--all potentially hazardous to aircraft.

## Dust & volcanic ash

## Recognition of critical WX situations from the ground & in flight
