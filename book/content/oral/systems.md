## Magnetic compass

**Magnetic deviation**

Instruments in your airplane cause interference that affects your compass, and that interference is called deviation. Inside the compass, there are compensating magnets to counteract these fields of interference. A compass card is normally attached, showing what error correction to add for different headings, although the changes are normally just a few degrees.

**Magnetic variation**

Variation is the difference between true north and magnetic north. Isogonic lines are drawn on your sectional charts to show different lines of magnetic variation to help with planning your magnetic heading. "East is least, West is best."

**Acceleration error**

* Accelerate
* North 
* Decelerate
* South

Error is greatest on easterly/westerly headings.

**Turning error**

* North
* Opposite
* South
* Exaggerated

During a turn from a Northerly heading, the compass briefly indicates a turn in the opposite direction. As for aircraft turning from a Southerly heading, the compass indicates a turn in the correct direction, but at a faster rate than is actually being turned.
