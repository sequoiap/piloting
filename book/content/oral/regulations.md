## Aviation Safety Reporting Program

Pilots can self-report incidents to NASA under the Aviation Safety Reporting Program. The FAA will not use any reports submitted to that program for any enforcement action against pilots, except in the case of accidents or criminal offenses. By submitting a report within 10 days, the pilot may be provided some immunity from civil penalty or supension of certificate by the FAA.
