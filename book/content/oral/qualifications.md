# Pilot Qualifications

## Private pilot privileges and limitations

## Required documents & medical certificate

For student pilots, for any solo flight, you must have in your possession:

* Student pilot certificate
* Photo ID
* Medical certificate
* Current logbook endorsement

Once a full fledged pilot, the logbook endorsement is no longer necessary.

## Logbook & flight records

## Currency requirements vs proficiency

*Currency* is the documented verification that you meet the legal requirements 
to be able to fly (for example, three landings to a full stop in the preceding 
90 days before flying passengers at night). It means that you have met the 
requirements to act as a pilot in command of an aircraft within a certain time 
period. 

*Proficiency* is more subjective, and is your responsibility to decide whether
you've mastered the required skills for the safe operation of the flight.
To become proficient, you should practice your skills in an aircraft.

## Personal minimums & unfamiliar aircraft

It's a good idea (a must, really) to maintain personal minimums once you're 
no longer legally limited by restrictions specified by your flight instructor.
This will help you make better, clear-cut go/no-go decisions in questionable
situations. For example, personal minimums on max wind speed, max crosswind
speed, or minimum visibility can help keep you safer. Having personal minimums
can also help you explain to potentially harried passengers that you have
strict rules for yourself that you won't violate just for convenience's sake.
